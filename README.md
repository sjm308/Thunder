# Thunder

This is a project that the analytics team of the Oklahoma City Thunder tasked me with during their interview process.

I was provided a dataset and was asked to analyze and answer several questions about the data.
I was also asked to develop my own model with the intent of predicting playoff success using only the provided daata.
